This script was created to clean up an external hard drive with data scattered all over the place.
The user, in this file, specifies the directory to where all the files are located and then creates folders for the
	file extension of all the files in the directory and all the sub-directories.
The program then copies or moves the files into the new directory that the program made for those specific files.
